In my understanding Physical, Emotional, Mental and Spiritual health and vibrancy are all interconnected, and as such I often see more fluidity with Spiritual and Energetical bodies as things start to come more in-balance and free.
            
            Bowen brings potential for remembering and releasing old trauma and old injuries. And for highlighting and releasing areas where you may feel stuck in life. It has massive potential for bringing focus, insight and balance for moving forward positively, with improved health, vibrancy, calm and clarity.',

            Others are ready for more in-depth work, including emotional, mental and energetical layers. These are accessed through tuning deeply into the body and using itâ€™s natural insight and guidance to work with what is presenting in a multi-layered way.
            
            Bowen is great following a deep process and can help shift blocked energy which is ready to be released. It is also great for realigning and activating, so that you can move forward from a freer space.',
