            How would you describe your current Meditation Practice, in terms of Dedication and Frequency on a scale of 0 to 10?
            (0 being non-existent and 10 being it is an inherent part of who you are).
            How Easeful is your meditation practice, in terms of Focus and Enjoyment?
            (0 difficulty in staying focused and still and 10 easily dropping into connection).
            How much Benefit are you getting from meditation?
            (0 it causes stress and I am in my head efforting, 10 it brings me to a place of centered calm).',
